Twitch Plays D2

Let twitch chat users control Diablo II.
Supports running server (read irc, parse commands, send to window), and overlay/overlay-server on different machines.

Notes: If running the server in a VM, don't try to run from a virtual box share. Grunt-watch will not work with vboxfs.

Warning: Code is a rat's nest, has not been cleaned up, and is not release quality. There are some hardcoded paths. I decided to post it anyway because it may still be of use to someone. I may clean it up in the future for additional TwitchPlays projects.

IRC bootstrapping and config loader originally forked from TwitchPlaysX.
